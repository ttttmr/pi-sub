# sub-bar

Usage widget extension for [pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent).

Displays current provider usage in a widget below the editor. Fetching and caching are handled by `sub-core`.

## Installation

Install via the pi package manager (recommended). `sub-bar` bundles `sub-core`, so you only need to install sub-bar:

```bash
pi install npm:@eiei114/pi-sub-bar
```

Use `-l` to install into project settings instead of global:

```bash
pi install -l npm:@eiei114/pi-sub-bar
```

If you previously installed `sub-core` separately, remove it from `~/.pi/agent/extensions` or `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` to avoid duplicate core instances.

Manual install (local development):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eiei114/pi-sub.git
cd pi-sub
npm install

ln -s /path/to/pi-sub/packages/sub-bar ~/.pi/agent/extensions/sub-bar
```

For local development, also ensure sub-core is available (either link it separately or link it into `packages/sub-bar/node_modules`).

Alternative (no symlink): add sub-bar to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    "/path/to/pi-sub/packages/sub-bar/index.ts"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

The extension loads automatically. Use:

- `sub-bar:settings` - Open display + provider UI settings (includes Provider Shown)
- `sub-bar:import <share string>` - Preview a shared theme and choose to save/apply
- `sub-core:settings` - Configure provider enablement/order + usage/status refresh settings
- `Ctrl+Alt+P` - Cycle through available providers (configurable)
- `Ctrl+Alt+R` - Toggle reset timer format (configurable)

**Keybindings:**

Shortcuts are configurable via `sub-bar:settings` → Keybindings. Enter any valid key combo (e.g. `ctrl+alt+p`, `ctrl+shift+s`) or `none` to disable a shortcut. Keybinding changes take effect after pi restart.

**Caching:**
- Handled by sub-core at `~/.pi/agent/cache/sub-core/cache.json`
- Cache TTL matches your auto-refresh interval setting
- Lock file prevents race conditions between multiple pi windows

## Communication with sub-core

`sub-bar` is a display client. It listens for `sub-core:update-current`/`sub-core:ready` events and renders the widget. On startup it requests the current state via `sub-core:request`.

`sub-bar` manages display settings and UI-only provider options (window visibility, labels, status indicator). Provider enablement lives in sub-core, but the sub-bar settings UI can toggle Enabled (auto/on/off) and forwards changes to `sub-core:settings:patch`. Ordering and refresh behavior are configured in `sub-core:settings`, and sub-core broadcasts updates that sub-bar consumes. The cycle command forwards to `sub-core:action` so core updates provider selection and then broadcasts the new state.

## Settings

Display and provider UI settings are stored in `~/.pi/agent/pi-sub-bar-settings.json` (migrated from the legacy extension `settings.json` when present; the legacy file is removed after a successful migration). Core settings are managed by sub-core, and the sub-bar settings menu includes a shortcut that points you to `sub-core:settings` for additional options.

**Settings migrations:** settings are merged with defaults on load, but renames/removals are not migrated automatically. When adding new settings or changing schema, update the defaults/merge logic and provide a migration (or instruct users to reset `pi-sub-bar-settings.json`).

### Provider UI Settings

Use `sub-bar:settings` → Provider Settings to control enabled state (auto/on/off), status indicators, and per-provider window visibility.

OpenRouter separates the API key in use from the account wallet, so each has its
own toggles and neither set relabels the other's data:

| Setting | Default | Shows |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Show Key Limit Window | on | `Key limit` percentage window (only for a real numeric cap) |
| Show Key Spend | on | `Key spend: $…` and `Key cap: $…` / `Key cap: none` |
| Show Credits Window | on | `Credits` percentage window for the account wallet |
| Show Remaining Credit | on | `Account credit: $… left`, or `Account credit: unavailable` when the wallet could not be read |
| Show Credit Breakdown | off | Appends used/total to the account credit line |

An uncapped key has nothing to draw a bar for, so it shows only the key and
account lines — a snapshot without windows is still rendered when it carries
these extras.

### Core Settings

Use `sub-core:settings` to configure provider enablement (auto/on/off), fetch status, usage refresh settings, status refresh settings, and provider order.

### Display Settings

Use Display Settings → Theme to save, load, import, and randomize display themes.

Display Settings cover layout, bars, labels/text, reset timers, status indicators, dividers, and color tuning. Open `sub-bar:settings` → Display Settings to explore the full list in the UI.

## Credentials

Credentials are loaded by sub-core from:

- `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` - pi's auth file
- Provider-specific locations (e.g., `~/.codex/auth.json`, `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`)
- macOS Keychain for Claude Code credentials
- Environment variables (e.g., `Z_AI_API_KEY`, `XAI_OAUTH_TOKEN`)

xAI (Grok) shows the **subscription** quota of the base `xai` OAuth entry only. `XAI_API_KEY` is not used: it is a valid developer-API credential, but that API cannot report subscription quota. Numbered accounts (`xai-2`, …) show no usage rather than the base account's numbers, and the endpoint is unofficial, so it can break without notice.

## Development

### Packaging notes (pi install compatibility)

Pi packages use a `pi` field in `package.json` plus the `pi-package` keyword for discoverability. This repo already declares `pi.extensions`, so you can install via:

```bash
pi install npm:@eiei114/pi-sub-core
pi install npm:@eiei114/pi-sub-bar
```

Manual paths/symlinks still work for local development as documented above.

### Adding a New Provider

Update both sub-core (fetch) and sub-bar (display). See `sub-core/README.md` for the full checklist.

### Feature placement (UI vs core)

- **sub-bar** owns presentation (formatting, layout, status indicators, UI settings).
- **sub-core** owns data fetching, caching, provider selection, and shared settings/events.
- Add shared types to **sub-shared** when both layers reference them.

See the root README “Developer guide” for the full decision checklist and examples.

### Commands

```bash
npm run check
```
